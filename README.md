# Implementation of Modularity and community structure in networks

This project is an implementation of Modularity and community structure in networks by M. E. J. Newman in C. <br>
the code was part of an academic project, and the format was as requested. <br>
The output is the communities detected by the algorithm. <br>
In the project, there is an implementation of the optimization suggested in the article as well. <br>
The results was top in class as well as the running time of the code because of the data structure used in the implementation.<br>
